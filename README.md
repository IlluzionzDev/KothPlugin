# Koth Plugin
This is a demo plugin to show the Koth gamemode. Not fully production ready and uses some demo shortcuts
to get the concept up and running.

## Setup an arena
Before you can start playing you need to setup the arena locations, there are 4 to set.

- Blue spawn location | /koth setloc bluespawn
- Red spawn location | /koth setloc redspawn
- Capture zone location1 | /koth setloc capture1
- Capture zone location2 | /koth setloc capture2

To then start a game run /koth start and a game will be started with all online players

## Main Features
- Two teams (Red & Blue)
- Basic Kit System
- Respawn system
- Death effects and messages
- Point system
- Kills & Deaths stats
- Winners get 5 diamonds each
- Game lasts 15 minutes each with the goal of having the most points

## Possible Areas of Improvement
These are more features that I would love to see in a koth gamemode. Reason for them being left out here
is this is a demo and I didn't want to waste time on features if this is only showing a concept. These are features
that could easily be added in should this gamemode be developed further to be production ready.

- Final leaderboard system showing top kills and captures
- Selection of kill effects
